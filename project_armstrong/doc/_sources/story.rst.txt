Background story
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The first and only spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was NASA’s Galileo spacecraft,
which launched on October 18, 1989. It arrived at Jupiter on December 8, 1995
after 2,242 days of flight time. NASA’s Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 and
Voyager 1 and 2 did the journey in ~600 days.

However, these spacecrafts were just flying by, none of them went into orbit
around Jupiter or any of its moons. And now, more than 30 years later
after Galileo, **Project Armstrong**'s spacecraft tries to reach Europa
in just 505 days and land on its surface.
With the latest rocket engine developments approaching Europa in ~500 days
is not a problem. However, slowing down after entering its gravitational field
and landing on it is not an easy task.


Mission
^^^^^^^

Your mission is to design and develop a bare metal application in C
to control the descent propulsion system of ELM (Europa Lunar Module).

The application receives data about the surface relief and the target
landing point(s). Also receives ELM's current speed, current position and
current direction. Based on these inputs it commands the ELM to switch on or off
the propulsion systems. This way the ELM can speed up, slow down or it can even
change its direction. Like in the `Moonlander game <http://moonlander.seb.ly/>`_.

In order to start the mission as soon as possible the spacecraft was launched
before the firmware responsible for controlling the landing gears was complete.
Your team must develop a new firmware and update the spacecraft's control system
before the landing date: **15 April 2020**. Upon uploading the new firmware the
spacecraft's control system will execute several landing zones related tests
to validate the image. Some tests can be executed locally as well.
See :ref:`python-based-simulator`.

Several great developer teams are competing to build the firmware for ELM's control
system, but only the best solution will be accepted.

**Will your team be the best? Are you ready for the challenge?**
