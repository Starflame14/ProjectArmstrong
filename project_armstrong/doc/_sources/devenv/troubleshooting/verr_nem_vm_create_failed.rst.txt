VirtualBox: VERR_NEM_VM_CREATE_FAILED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are mainly two reasons for this:


* **VT-x/AMD-V is not enabled**\ : please reboot your machine and enter BIOS.
  Check that you have ``VT-x/AMD-V`` enabled.

* **Running on Windows Hyper-V is enabled**\ : you need to disable Hyper-V.
  Follow the instructions described `here <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v#enable-the-hyper-v-role-through-settings>`_.
