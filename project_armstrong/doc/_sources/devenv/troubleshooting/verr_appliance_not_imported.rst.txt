VirtualBox: Appliance import failed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If for some reason the import of the appliance (\ ``.ova``\ ) file failed because
some other reasons than the ones discussed above, you can still try to add
the virtual machine image manually. To do this, first you have to download
the image using
`this torrent <https://www.projectarmstrong.hu/app/data/2020/arm_hackathon_zip.torrent>`_.
Unpack its content and you will have an ``arm_hackathon`` folder with several
files inside.

Start ``VirtualBoxÂ®`` and click ``Machine -> Add...`` or press ``CTRL+A``.
Select the ``arm_hackathon.vbox`` file from the previously mentioned
``arm_hackathon`` folder. Click ``Open``.

A new virtual machine ``arm_hackathon`` will be created.
