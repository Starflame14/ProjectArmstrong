VirtualBox: VERR_VM_DRIVER_NOT_INSTALLED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encountered on Ubuntu 19.04.
This is a very unlikely and unfortunate situation.

Drop to console and run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sudo /sbin/vboxconfig

The command is expected to fail and prints something like this:

.. code-block:: shell

   vboxdrv.sh: failed: Look at /var/log/vbox-setup.log to find out what went wrong.

Now look into the log file and try to find the first error message:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cat /var/log/vbox-setup.log | grep -m1 "error:"

If the error message is something like ``error: unknown type name ‘__uint128_t’``
or very similar it might mean that you have to install Linux kernel headers.
You can check it by running the command below.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ls /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r) >/dev/null
   ls: cannot access '/usr/src/linux-headers-5.0.0-38-generic': No such file or directory

If it says so like above you should install the missing headers:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

Now try to configure VirtualBox® once again:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sudo /sbin/vboxconfig

It should succeed this time and your system is ready to run the development
environment.
