Arm DS IDE has a lot of tutorials and videos available.
It is very much advised to search for materials in the ``Help`` menu first because
it is very likely that you can find valuable answers there.
For a small example, it is possible to debug bare metal applications running in
an FVP instance using Arm DS IDE.
