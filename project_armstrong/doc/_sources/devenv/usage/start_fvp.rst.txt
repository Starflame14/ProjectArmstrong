Starting an Arm Fixed Virtual Platform(FVP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arm Fixed Virtual Platform, FVP, is a simulation system including processor,
memory and peripherals. FVP gives a great way to start bare metal coding. It
accepts a software binary built for Armv8-M or Armv8-A architecture and executes
it like a real hardware. It is very similar to `QEMU <https://www.qemu.org/>`_.

FVP can be started from terminal. Press ``Ctrl + Alt + T`` or use the application
browser to launch a ``Terminal``.
Simply type ``FVP_MPS2_Cortex-M0`` and press ``Enter``.
