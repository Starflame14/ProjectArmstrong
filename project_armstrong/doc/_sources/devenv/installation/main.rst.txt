Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read on to learn all you need to do to kickstart the environment.
Just for the reference, the following step-by-step guide was tested on

* Ubuntu 19.04,
* macOS Catalina 10.15.3 and
* Windows 10

platforms.

Step 1 - Installing VirtualBox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get `ORACLE® VM VirtualBox® version 6.0.16 <https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.16/>`_
for your preferred platform and follow the installation instructions.
It is advised to use installers, if available.

You are **not** required to install ``Oracle® VM VirtualBox® Extension Pack`` for
the base setup. Of course, you can install it if you wish so but make sure you
read and understand its
`license <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL>`_.

Step 2 - Importing the virtual machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After ``VirtualBox®`` installed, download the appliance file using the following
`torrent file <https://www.projectarmstrong.hu/app/data/2020/arm_hackathon_ova.torrent>`_.

Start ``VirtualBox®`` and click ``File -> Import Appliance...`` or press ``CTRL+I``.
You should see a window similar to the one in the image below.
There is no need to go ``Expert Mode``\ , just saying.

Now find the previously downloaded virtual machine (\ ``.ova``\ ) file in your local
filesystem, select it and click ``Next``.

The next window looks like it is encouraging you to change some settings but
besides selecting an appropriate ``Machine Base Folder`` and maybe choosing a
custom ``Name`` for the machine there is no need to modify anything.

Now click ``Import``. This might take some time depending on the capabilities of
your machine. It is high time to grab some snacks or a cup of coffee.

Step 3 - Starting the virtual machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the import has finished a new machine should appear in the list.

Double click it to start the machine. In the very unlikely situation an error
message is shown instead of a booting Ubuntu please refer to the
:ref:`troubleshoot <troubleshooting>` section.
